Methods                                  We analysed the baseline information from a longitudinal study in southwestern China. Women's brachial and central blood pressure and pulse pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, and their 48-hour personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM                  2.5                  ) and black carbon were measured in summer and winter. We evaluated the associations between exposure to air pollution and haemodynamic parameters using mixed-effects regression models adjusted for known cardiovascular risk factors.                                                            Results                                  Women's (n=205, ages 27--86 years) exposures to PM                  2.5                  and black carbon ranged from 14 {\textmu}g/m                  3                  to 1405\,{\textmu}g/m                  3                  and 0.1--121.8\,{\textmu}g/m                  3                  , respectively. Among women aged {$\geq$}50 years, increased PM                  2.5                  exposure was associated with higher systolic (brachial: 3.5\,mm Hg (P=0.05); central: 4.4\,mm Hg (P=0.005)) and diastolic blood pressure (central: 1.3\,mm Hg (P=0.10)), higher pulse pressure (peripheral: 2.5\,mm Hg (P=0.05); central: 2.9\,mm Hg (P=0.008)) and lower peripheral--central pulse pressure amplification (-0.007 (P=0.04)). Among younger women, the associations were inconsistent in the direction of effect and not statistically significant. Increased PM                  2.5                  exposure was associated with no difference in pulse wave velocity and modestly higher augmentation index though the CI included zero (1.1\%; 95\%\,CI -0.2\% to 2.4\%). Similar associations were found for black carbon exposure.                                                            Conclusions                Exposure to household air pollution was associated with higher blood pressure and central haemodynamics in older Chinese women, with no associations observed with pulse wave velocity.},

  abstract = {Mediation analysis offers an essential and rapidly expanding tool in environmental health studies to investigate the contribution of environmental factors towards observed associations between risk factors and health outcomes. When evaluating environmental factors, there may be particular interest in quantifying the impact of exposure to environmental mixtures on human health. In this context, evaluating the joint effect of multiple chemicals or pollutants, rather than individual examination, allows accurate identification of risk factors, assessment of interactions, and ultimately development of more targeted public health interventions. While mediation analysis has been extended to incorporate several methodological complexities specific to environmental factors, little attention has been given to integrating the analysis of environmental mixtures. The aim of this review is to present some of the available methods for environmental mixtures, and discuss how these methods can be integrated within a mediation analysis framework. By incorporating these methods into a mediation framework, investigators will be able to evaluate the contribution of environmental mixtures as mediators of exposure-outcome associations, based on methodologies that are currently available. While standard regression-based methods for multiple mediators can be used, these can easily become unstable as the number of mixture components increases. Summary and classification methods, or hierarchical modeling, can reduce the number of mediators by creating scores or possibly uncorrelated subgroups. This approach allows retrieving indirect effects due to the mixture or to a specific subgroup, but makes identification of component-specific effects and interactions complicated. Finally, one can use various approaches for analyzing mixtures in a two-stage fashion, selecting relevant mediators to be included in the final model. We focused this review on techniques that have been presented to the environmental health community and that can be conducted with major statistical software. We encourage researchers to move beyond the evaluation of one environmental factor at a time to the assessment of the joint effects of environmental mixtures when a mediation model is of interest. Available methods target different aspects related to environmental mixtures and the choice of the suitable approach will depend on data structures and the research question of interest.},

Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes among those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.},

This chapter reviews a number of important, recent developments related to difference-in-differences. First, this chapter reviews recent work pointing out limitations of two-way fixed-effects regressions (these are panel data regressions that have been the dominant approach to implementing difference-in-differences identification strategies) that arise in empirically relevant settings where there are more than two time periods, variation in treatment timing across units, and treatment effect heterogeneity. Second, this chapter reviews recently proposed alternative approaches that are able to circumvent these issues without being substantially more complicated to implement. Third, this chapter covers a number of extensions to these results, paying particular attention to (i) parallel trends assumptions that hold only after conditioning on observed covariates and (ii) strategies to partially identify causal effect parameters in difference-in-differences applications in cases where the parallel trends assumption may be violated.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001--2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Central blood pressure (BP) can be estimated noninvasively by analyzing brachial artery waveforms. In this study, our aim was to assess the validity of a brachial cuff-based (suprasystolic) technique for estimating central BP (CBPestimated) by comparison with invasive aortic BP (CBPinvasive).Eighty-four simultaneous CBPestimated (Pulsecor R7.0) and CBPinvasive measures were recorded in 47 patients (aged 63{\textpm}10 years, 62\% male) undergoing coronary angiography. Measures were captured at baseline and acutely following intravenous glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; 100--200 {$\mu$}g). Mean CBPinvasive systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were compared with CBPestimated SBP and DBP calibrated with brachial SBP and DBP recorded from the Pulsecor device. To test validity of the central BP algorithm, measures of CBPestimated SBP were also compared with CBPinvasive SBP following recalibration with invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and DBP.At baseline, mean difference {\textpm} standard deviation between CBPestimated SBP and CBPinvasive SBP was -7{\textpm}9mm Hg (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.86; P \&lt; 0.001) with similar underestimation post-GTN (-6{\textpm}9mm Hg; ICC = 0.90; P \&lt; 0.001). Recalibration of CBPestimated SBP with invasive MAP and DBP resulted in closer mean difference to CBPinvasive SBP (-2{\textpm}7mm Hg; ICC = 0.95; P \&lt; 0.001) at baseline but not post-GTN (-6{\textpm}7mm Hg; ICC = 0.95; P \&lt; 0.001).The Pulsecor algorithm to derive central BP has acceptable validity when calibrated with invasive pressures. However, accuracy is compromised when noninvasive brachial cuff BP calibration is used.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relevance to coronary heart disease (CHD) of cytokines that govern inflammatory cascades, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), may be underestimated because such mediators are short acting and prone to fluctuations. We evaluated associations of long-term circulating IL-6 levels with CHD risk (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or fatal CHD) in two population-based cohorts, involving serial measurements to enable correction for within-person variability. We updated a systematic review to put the new findings in context. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Measurements were made in samples obtained at baseline from 2,138 patients who had a first-ever nonfatal MI or died of CHD during follow-up, and from 4,267 controls in two cohorts comprising 24,230 participants. Correction for within-person variability was made using data from repeat measurements taken several years apart in several hundred participants. The year-to-year variability of IL-6 values within individuals was relatively high (regression dilution ratios of 0.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.53, over 4 y, and 0.35, 95\% CI 0.23-0.48, over 12 y). Ignoring this variability, we found an odds ratio for CHD, adjusted for several established risk factors, of 1.46 (95\% CI 1.29-1.65) per 2 standard deviation (SD) increase of baseline IL-6 values, similar to that for baseline C-reactive protein. After correction for within-person variability, the odds ratio for CHD was 2.14 (95\% CI 1.45-3.15) with long-term average ("usual") IL-6, similar to those for some established risk factors. Increasing IL-6 levels were associated with progressively increasing CHD risk. An updated systematic review of electronic databases and other sources identified 15 relevant previous population-based prospective studies of IL-6 and clinical coronary outcomes (i.e., MI or coronary death). Including the two current studies, the 17 available prospective studies gave a combined odds ratio of 1.61 (95\% CI 1.42-1.83) per 2 SD increase in baseline IL-6 (corresponding to an odds ratio of 3.34 [95\% CI 2.45-4.56] per 2 SD increase in usual [long-term average] IL-6 levels). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term IL-6 levels are associated with CHD risk about as strongly as are some major established risk factors, but causality remains uncertain. These findings highlight the potential relevance of IL-6-mediated pathways to CHD.},

  abstract = {During the 1980s the Republic of Ireland experienced repeated severe pollution episodes. Domestic coal burning was a major source of this pollution. In 1990 the Irish government introduced a ban on the marketing, sale, and distribution of coal in Dublin. The ban was extended to Cork in 1995 and to 10 other communities in 1998 and 2000. We previously reported decreases in particulate black smoke (BS*) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations, measured as total gaseous acidity, in Dublin after the 1990 coal ban (Clancy et al. 2002). In the current study we explored and compared the effectiveness of the sequential 1990, 1995, and 1998 bans in reducing community air pollution and in improving public health. We compiled records of daily BS, total gaseous acidity (SO2), and counts of cause-specific deaths from 1981 to 2004 for Dublin County Borough (1990 ban), county Cork (1995 ban), and counties Limerick, Louth, Wexford, and Wicklow (1998 ban). We also compiled daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive diagnoses for Cork County Borough (1991 to 2004) and counties Limerick, Louth, Wexford, and Wicklow (1993 to 2004). We compared pre-ban and post-ban BS and SO2 concentrations for each city. Using interrupted time-series methods, we estimated the change in cause-specific, directly standardized mortality rates in each city or county after the corresponding local coal ban. We regressed weekly age- and sex-standardized mortality rates against an indicator of the post- versus pre-ban period, adjusting for influenza epidemics, weekly mean temperature, and a season smooth of the standardized mortality rates in Coastal counties presumably not affected by the bans. We compared these results with similar analyses in Midlands counties also presumably unaffected by the bans. We also estimated the change in cause-specific, directly standardized, weekly hospital admissions rates normalized for underreporting in each city or county after the 1995 and 1998 bans, adjusting for influenza epidemics, weekly mean temperature, and local admissions for digestive diagnoses. Mean BS concentrations fell in all affected population centers post-ban compared with the pre-ban period, with decreases ranging from 4 to 35 microg/m3 (corresponding to reductions of 45\% to 70\%, respectively), but we observed no clear pattern in SO2 measured as total gaseous acidity associated with the bans. In comparisons with the pre-ban periods, no significant reduction was found in total death rates associated with the 1990 (1\% reduction), 1995 (4\% reduction), or 1998 (0\% reduction) bans, nor for cardiovascular mortality (0\%, 4\%, and 1\% reductions for the 1990, 1995, and 1998 bans, respectively). Respiratory mortality was reduced in association with the bans (17\%, 9\%, and 3\%, respectively). We found a 4\% decrease in hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease associated with the 1995 ban and a 3\% decrease with the 1998 ban. Admissions for respiratory disease were not consistently lower after the bans; admissions for pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma were reduced. However, underreporting of hospital admissions data and lack of control and comparison series tempered our confidence in these results. The successive coal bans resulted in immediate and sustained decreases in particulate concentrations in each city or town; with the largest decreases in winter and during the heating season. The bans were associated with reductions in respiratory mortality but no detectable improvement in cardiovascular mortality. The changes in hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disease were supportive of these findings but cannot be considered confirming. Detecting changes in public health indicators associated even with clear improvements in air quality, as in this case, remains difficult when there are simultaneous secular improvements in the same health indicators.},

  abstract = {Several studies have investigated the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants in the development of high blood pressure and hypertension. However, little information exists regarding the health effects of long-term exposure. To investigate the association between residential long-term exposure to air pollution and blood pressure and hypertension, we studied 24 845 Chinese adults in 11 districts of 3 northeastern cities from 2009 to 2010. Three-year average concentration of particles with an aerodynamic diameter {$\leq$}10 {\textmu}m (PM               10               ), sulfur dioxide (SO               2               ), nitrogen dioxides (NO               2               ), and ozone (O               3               ) were calculated from monitoring stations in the 11 districts. We used generalized additive models and 2-level logistic regressions models to examine the health effects. The results showed that the odds ratio for hypertension increased by 1.12 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.08--1.16) per 19 {$\mu$}g/m               3               increase in PM               10               , 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.04--1.18) per 20 {$\mu$}g/m               3               increase in SO               2               , and 1.13 (95\% CI, 1.06--1.20) per 22 {$\mu$}g/m               3               increase in O               3               . The estimated increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 0.87 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.48--1.27) and 0.32 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.08--0.56) per 19 {$\mu$}g/m               3               interquartile increase in PM               10               , 0.80 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.46--1.14) and 0.31 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.10--0.51) per 20 {$\mu$}g/m               3               interquartile increase in SO               2               , and 0.73 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.35--1.11) and 0.37 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.14--0.61) per 22 {$\mu$}g/m               3               interquartile increase in O               3               . These associations were only statistically significant in men. In conclusion, long-term exposure to PM               10               , SO               2               , and O               3               was associated with increased arterial blood pressure and hypertension in the study population.},

The authors urge clinicians to evaluate each patient on maintenance antipsychotic therapy in terms of feasibility of drug withdrawal and offer practical guidelines for withdrawal and subsequent management.},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Two-way fixed effects methods have been used to estimate effects of policies adopted in different places over time, but they can provide misleading results when effects are heterogeneous or dynamic, and alternate methods have been proposed.           Methods:~           We compared methods for estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under staggered adoption of policies, including two-way fixed effects, group-time ATT, cohort ATT, and target-trial approaches. We applied each method to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on preterm birth using the National Center for Health Statistics' birth records. We compared each estimator's performance in a simulation parameterized to mimic the empirical example. We generated constant, heterogeneous, and dynamic effects and calculated bias, mean squared error, and confidence interval coverage of each estimator across 1000 iterations.           Results:~           Two-way fixed effects estimated that Medicaid expansion increased the risk of preterm birth (risk difference [RD], 0.12; 95\% CI = 0.02, 0.22), while the group-time ATT, cohort ATT, and target-trial approaches estimated protective or null effects (group-time RD, -0.16; 95\% CI = -0.58, 0.26; cohort RD, -0.02; 95\% CI = -0.46, 0.41; target trial RD, -0.16; 95\% CI = -0.59, 0.26). In simulations, two-way fixed effects performed well when treatment effects were constant and less well under heterogeneous and dynamic effects.           Conclusions:~           We demonstrated why new approaches perform better than two-way fixed effects when treatment effects are heterogeneous or dynamic under a staggered policy adoption design, and created simulation and analysis code to promote understanding and wider use of these methods in the epidemiologic literature.},

Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of two-way fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

Methods               Using mixed-effects regression models, we investigated the associations of household air pollution with blood pressure (BP) and vascular function in 753 adults (ages 40--79 years) from 3 diverse provinces in China. We conducted repeated measures of participants' household fuel use, personal exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5), BP, brachial--femoral pulse wave velocity (bfPWV), and augmentation index. Ultrasound images of the carotid arteries were obtained to assess intima--media thickness (CIMT) and plaques. Covariate information on sociodemographics, health behaviors, 24-h urinary sodium, and blood lipids was also obtained.                                         Results               Average estimated yearly personal exposure to PM2.5 was 97.5 {\textmu}g/m3 (SD: 79.2; range: 3.5--1241), and 65\% of participants cooked with solid fuel. In multivariable models, current solid fuel use was associated with higher systolic (2.4 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -0.4, 4.9) and diastolic BP (1.4 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -0.1, 3.0) and greater total area of plaques (1.7 mm2, 95\% CI: -6.5, 9.8) compared with exclusive use of electricity or gas stoves. A 1 - ln({\textmu}g/m3) increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher systolic (1.5 mm Hg, 95\% CI: 0.2, 2.7) and diastolic BP (1.0 mm Hg, 95\% CI: 0.4, 1.7) and with greater CIMT (0.02 mm, 95\% CI: 0.00, 0.04) and total area of plaques (4.7 mm2, 95\% CI: -2.0, 11.5). We did not find associations with arterial stiffness, except for a lower bfPWV (-1.5 m/s, 95\% CI: -3.0, -0.0) among users of solid fuel heaters.                                         Conclusions               These findings add to limited evidence that household air pollution is associated with higher BP and with greater CIMT and total plaque area.},

Frequently, oxidative and nitrosative stress are hypothesized to mediate these pollution effects, however precise mechanisms remain unclear. This paper describes the methodology for a major panel study to examine air pollution effects on these and other mechanistic pathways. The study took place during the drastic air pollution changes accompanying the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. After a general description of air pollution health effects, we provide a discussion of panel studies and describe the unique features of this study that make it likely to provide compelling results. This study should lead to a clearer and more precise definition of the role of oxidative and nitrosative stress, as well as other mechanisms, in determining acute morbidity and mortality from air pollution exposure.},

As part of a baseline assessment of the program, this study investigated variability in personal air pollution exposures within villages and between villages and evaluated exposure patterns by sociodemographic factors. We randomly recruited 446 participants in 50 villages in four districts in rural Beijing and measured 24 h personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). The geometric mean personal exposure to PM2.5 and BC was 72 and 2.5 {$\mu$}g/m3, respectively. The variability in PM2.5 and BC exposures was greater within villages than between villages. Study participants who used traditional stoves as their dominant source of space heating were exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5 and BC. Wealthier households tended to burn more coal for space heating, whereas less wealthy households used more biomass. PM2.5 and BC exposures were almost uniformly distributed by socioeconomic status. Future work that combines these results with PM2.5 chemical composition analysis will shed light on whether air pollution source contributors (e.g., industrial, traffic, and household solid fuel burning) follow similar distributions.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in China is thought to have reduced air pollution emissions due to reduced human mobility and economic activities. Few studies have assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on community and indoor air quality in environments with diverse socioeconomic and household energy use patterns. The main goal of this study was to evaluate whether indoor and community air pollution differed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in homes with different energy use patterns. Using calibrated real-time PM2.5 sensors, we measured indoor and community air quality in 147 homes from 30 villages in Beijing over 4 months including periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Community pollution was higher during the lockdown (61 {\textpm} 47 {$\mu$}g/m3) compared with before (45 {\textpm} 35 {$\mu$}g/m3, p {$<$} 0.001) and after (47 {\textpm} 37 {$\mu$}g/m3, p {$<$} 0.001) the lockdown. However, we did not observe significantly increased indoor PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Indoor-generated PM2.5 in homes using clean energy for heating without smokers was the lowest compared with those using solid fuel with/without smokers, implying air pollutant emissions are reduced in homes using clean energy. Indoor air quality may not have been impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown in rural settings in China and appeared to be more impacted by the household energy choice and indoor smoking than the COVID-19 lockdown. As clean energy transitions occurred in rural households in northern China, our work highlights the importance of understanding multiple possible indoor sources to interpret the impacts of interventions, intended or otherwise.},

The aim of this study was to describe the association between indoor temperature and physical performance in older adults. Eighty-one older adults (84\% women, mean age 80.9 years, standard deviation 6.53) were visited every four weeks from May to October 2015 and additionally during two heat waves in July and August 2015. Indoor temperature, habitual gait speed, chair-rise performance and balance were assessed. Baseline assessment of gait speed was used to create two subgroups (lower versus higher gait speed) based on frailty criteria. The strongest effect of increasing temperature on habitual gait speed was observed in the subgroup of adults with higher gait speed (-0.087 m/s per increase of 10 \,{$^\circ$}C; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -0.136; -0.038). The strongest effects on timed chair-rise and balance performance were observed in the subgroup of adults with lower gait speed (2.03 s per increase of 10 \,{$^\circ$}C (95\% CI: 0.79; 3.28) and -3.92 s per increase of 10 \,{$^\circ$}C (95\% CI: -7.31; -0.52), respectively). Comparing results of physical performance in absentia of a heat wave and during a heat wave, habitual gait speed was negatively affected by heat in the total group and subgroup of adults with higher gait speed, chair-rise performance was negatively affected in all groups and balance was not affected. The study provides arguments for exercise interventions in general for older adults, because a better physical fitness might alleviate impediments of physical capacity and might provide resources for adequate adaptation in older adults during heat stress.},

Methods of non-invasively estimating this pressure would therefore be helpful in clinical practice. To achieve this goal, a physics-based model is derived to correlate the arterial pressure under a suprasystolic upper-arm cuff to the aortic pressure. The model assumptions are particularly applicable to the measurement method and result in a time--domain relation with two parameters, namely, the wave propagation transit time and the reflection coefficient at the cuff. Central pressures estimated by the model were derived from completely automatic, non-invasive measurement of brachial blood pressure and suprasystolic waveform and were compared to simultaneous invasive catheter measurements in 16 subjects. Systolic blood pressure agreement, mean (standard deviation) of difference was -1 (7)mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure agreement was 4 (4)mmHg. Correlation between estimated and actual central waveforms was greater than 90\%. Individualization of model parameters did not significantly improve systolic and diastolic pressure agreement, but increased waveform correlation. Further research is necessary to confirm that more accurate brachial pressure measurement improves central pressure estimation.},

Each dwelling was assessed for temperature, relative humidity, air pollution and biological pollution, as well as blood pressure parameters related to the health of the elderly. The results showed that the temperature in urban dwellings was higher and more stable than that in rural dwellings, due to the difference in heating devices. Indoor carbon dioxide (CO               2               ) concentrations in some dwellings exceeded the limit. Indoor formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds (VOC) were lower than the limit values, while urban dwellings had more formaldehyde and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) pollution than rural dwellings. For rural houses, indoor fuel combustion resulted in higher concentrations of particulate matter below 2.5 microns (PM               2.5               ) and higher concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO). The biological pollution in rural areas was generally higher than in urban areas. The blood pressure of the elderly in rural areas was higher than that in urban areas, and blood pressure was found to be negatively correlated with room temperature and positively correlated with relative humidity. These results can provide an indicator for the improvement of housing environmental quality for older people in China.},

  abstract = {Numerous particulate matter (PM) sensors with great development potential have emerged. However, whether the current sensors can be used for reliable long-term field monitoring is unclear. This study describes the research and application prospects of low-cost miniaturized sensors in PM2.5 monitoring. We evaluated five Plantower PMSA003 sensors deployed in Beijing, China, over 7 months (October 2019 to June 2020). The sensors tracked PM2.5 concentrations, which were compared to the measurements at the national control monitoring station of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) at the same location. The correlations of the data from the PMSA003 sensors and MEE reference monitors (R2 = 0.83{\textasciitilde}0.90) and among the five sensors (R2 = 0.91{\textasciitilde}0.98) indicated a high accuracy and intersensor correlation. However, the sensors tended to underestimate high PM2.5 concentrations. The relative bias reached -24.82\% when the PM2.5 concentration was {$>$}250 {\textmu}g/m3. Conversely, overestimation and high errors were observed during periods of high relative humidity (RH {$>$} 60\%). The relative bias reached 14.71\% at RH {$>$} 75\%. The PMSA003 sensors performed poorly during sand and dust storms, especially for the ambient PM10 concentration measurements. Overall, this study identified good correlations between PMSA003 sensors and reference monitors. Extreme field environments impact the data quality of low-cost sensors, and future corrections remain necessary.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Impacts of a newly launched rural residential solid fuel substitution campaign in China's Beijing--Tianjin--Hebei area on energy, emission, air quality, and exposure reveal that abating solid fuels will significantly reduce ambient and indoor air pollution, resulting in major health benefits. The campaign will help accelerate China's energy transition and reduce PM               2.5               emission and exposure. The expected exposure reduction is largely due to improved indoor air quality, resulting in greater benefits to women.                        ,                             In addition to many recent actions taken to reduce emissions from energy production, industry, and transportation, a new campaign substituting residential solid fuels with electricity or natural gas has been launched in Beijing, Tianjin, and 26 other municipalities in northern China, aiming at solving severe ambient air pollution in the region. Quantitative analysis shows that the campaign can accelerate residential energy transition significantly, and if the planned target can be achieved, more than 60\% of households are projected to remove solid fuels by 2021, compared with fewer than 20\% without the campaign. Emissions of major air pollutants will be reduced substantially. With 60\% substitution realized, emission of primary PM               2.5               and contribution to ambient PM               2.5               concentration in 2021 are projected to be 30\% and 41\% of those without the campaign. With 60\% substitution, average indoor PM               2.5               concentrations in living rooms in winter are projected to be reduced from 209 (190 to 230) {$\mu$}g/m               3               to 125 (99 to 150) {$\mu$}g/m               3               . The population-weighted PM               2.5               concentrations can be reduced from 140 {$\mu$}g/m               3               in 2014 to 78 {$\mu$}g/m               3               or 61 {$\mu$}g/m               3               in 2021 given that 60\% or 100\% substitution can be accomplished. Although the original focus of the campaign was to address ambient air quality, exposure reduction comes more from improved indoor air quality because {$\sim$}90\% of daily exposure of the rural population is attributable to indoor air pollution. Women benefit more than men.},

I use a simulation study to compare the bias and standard error of inverse probability weighting estimators from the TVT framework, a DiD framework, and hybrid approaches that combine ideas from both frameworks. I simulated longitudinal data with treatment effect heterogeneity over multiple time points using linear and logistic models. Simulation settings looked at both time-invariant confounders and time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment. Estimators that combined ideas from both frameworks had lower bias than standard TVT and DiD estimators when assumptions were unmet. The TVT framework provides estimation tools that can complement DiD tools in a wide range of applied settings. It also provides alternate estimands for consideration in policy settings.},

However, there is a longstanding debate on whether such effects are relevant targets of inference in population health. In light of the repeated calls for a more pragmatic and consequential epidemiology, we review three issues often raised in this debate: (i) the use of composite cross-world counterfactuals and the need for cross-world independence assumptions; (ii) interventional vs non-interventional identifiability; and (iii) the interpretational ambiguity of natural direct and indirect effect estimates. We use potential outcomes notation and directed acyclic graphs to explain 'cross-world' assumptions, illustrate implications of this assumption via regression models and discuss ensuing issues of interpretation. We argue that the debate on the relevance of natural direct and indirect effects rests on whether one takes as a target of inference the mathematical object per se, or the change in the world that the mathematical object represents. We further note that public health questions may be better served by estimating controlled direct effects.},

Design                Systematic review of studies that reported the effect of clean cookstove use on BP among women, and implementation science outcomes in LMICs.                                            Data sources                We searched PubMed, Embase, INSPEC, Scielo, Cochrane Library, Global Health and Web of Science PLUS. We conducted searches in November 2017 with a repeat in May 2018. We did not restrict article publication date.                                            Eligibility criteria for selecting studies                We included only studies conducted in LMICs, published in English, regardless of publication year and studies that examined the use of improved or clean cookstove intervention on BP. Two authors independently screened journal article titles, abstracts and full-text articles to identify those that included the following search terms: high BP, hypertension and or household air pollution, LMICs, cookstove and implementation outcomes.                                            Results                Of the 461 non-duplicate articles identified, three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in Nigeria, Guatemala and Ghana) and two studies of pre--post design (in Bolivia and Nicaragua) met eligibility criteria. These articles evaluated the effect of cookstove use on BP in women. Two of the three RCTs reported a mean reduction in diastolic BP of -2.8\,mm Hg (-5.0, --0.6; p=0.01) for the Nigerian study; -3.0\,mm Hg; (-5.7, --0.4; p=0.02) for the Guatemalan study; while the study conducted in Ghana reported a non-significant change in BP. The pre--post studies reported a significant reduction in mean systolic BP of -5.5\,mm Hg; (p=0.01) for the Bolivian study, and -5.9\,mm Hg (-11.3, --0.4; p=0.05) for the Nicaraguan study. Implementation science outcomes were reported in all five studies (three reported feasibility, one reported adoption and one reported feasibility and adoption of cookstove interventions).                                            Conclusion                Although this review demonstrated that there is limited evidence on the implementation of clean cookstove use in LMICs, the effects of clean cookstove on BP were significant for both systolic and diastolic BP among women. Future studies should consider standardised reporting of implementation outcomes.},

Although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear, it has been hypothesized that altered autonomic function and pulmonary/systemic inflammation may play a role. In this study we explored the effects of air pollution on autonomic function measured by changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and blood markers of inflammation in a panel of 88 elderly subjects from three communities along the Wasatch Front in Utah. Subjects participated in multiple sessions of 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and blood tests. Regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between fine particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microm (PM2.5)] and HRV, C-reactive protein (CRP), blood cell counts, and whole blood viscosity. A 100- microg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with approximately a 35 (SE = 8)-msec decline in standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN, a measure of overall HRV); a 42 (SE = 11)-msec decline in square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (r-MSSD, an estimate of short-term components of HRV); and a 0.81 (SE = 0.17)-mg/dL increase in CRP. The PM2.5-HRV associations were reasonably consistent and statistically robust, but the CRP association dropped to 0.19 (SE = 0.10) after excluding the most influential subject. PM2.5 was not significantly associated with white or red blood cell counts, platelets, or whole-blood viscosity. Most short-term variability in temporal deviations of HRV and CRP was not explained by PM2.5; however, the small statistically significant associations that were observed suggest that exposure to PM2.5 may be one of multiple factors that influence HRV and CRP.},

  abstract = {Approximately 3 billion people, most of whom live in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, rely on solid fuels (i.e. wood, crop wastes, dung, charcoal) and kerosene for their cooking needs. Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels -- such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels -- have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention programs are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world. We used the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adaptation, implementation, maintenance) framework to coordinate and evaluate the case studies. This paper describes the clean cooking case studies project, introduces the individual studies contained herein, and proposes a general conceptual model to support future planning and evaluation of household energy programs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since inflammation is believed to have a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, measurement of markers of inflammation has been proposed as a method to improve the prediction of the risk of these events. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nested case-control study among 28,263 apparently healthy postmenopausal women over a mean follow-up period of three years to assess the risk of cardiovascular events associated with base-line levels of markers of inflammation. The markers included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (sICAM-1). We also studied homocysteine and a variety of lipid and lipoprotein measurements. Cardiovascular events were defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, or the need for coronary-revascularization procedures. RESULTS: Of the 12 markers measured, hs-CRP was the strongest univariate predictor of the risk of cardiovascular events; the relative risk of events for women in the highest as compared with the lowest quartile for this marker was 4.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.2 to 8.9). Other markers significantly associated with the risk of cardiovascular events were serum amyloid A (relative risk for the highest as compared with the lowest quartile, 3.0), sICAM-1 (2.6), interleukin-6 (2.2), homocysteine (2.0), total cholesterol (2.4), LDL cholesterol (2.4), apolipoprotein B-100 (3.4), HDL cholesterol (0.3), and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (3.4). Prediction models that incorporated markers of inflammation in addition to lipids were significantly better at predicting risk than models based on lipid levels alone (P{\textexclamdown}0.001). The levels of hs-CRP and serum amyloid A were significant predictors of risk even in the subgroup of women with LDL cholesterol levels below 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter), the target for primary prevention established by the National Cholesterol Education Program. In multivariate analyses, the only plasma markers that independently predicted risk were hs-CRP (relative risk for the highest as compared with the lowest quartile, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.1) and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (relative risk, 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the measurement of C-reactive protein to screening based on lipid levels may provide an improved method of identifying persons at risk for cardiovascular events.},

  abstract = {Inflammation plays a major role in atherothrombosis, and measurement of inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) may provide a novel method for detecting individuals at high risk of plaque rupture. Several large-scale prospective studies demonstrate that HSCRP is a strong independent predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke among apparently healthy men and women and that the addition of HSCRP to standard lipid screening may improve global risk prediction among those with high as well as low cholesterol levels. Because agents such as aspirin and statins seem to attenuate inflammatory risk, HSCRP may also have utility in targeting proven therapies for primary prevention. Inexpensive commercial assays for HSCRP are now available; they have shown variability and classification accuracy similar to that of cholesterol screening. Risk prediction algorithms using a simple quintile approach to HSCRP evaluation have been developed for outpatient use. Thus, although limitations inherent to inflammatory screening remain, available data suggest that HSCRP has the potential to play an important role as an adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.},

Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion is responsible for 3-4 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and Global Warming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.},

First, conventional pre-trends tests may have low power. Second, conditioning the analysis on the result of a pretest can distort estimation and inference, potentially exacerbating the bias of point estimates and under-coverage of confidence intervals. I analyze these issues both in theory and in simulations calibrated to a survey of recent papers in leading economics journals, which suggest that these limitations are important in practice. I conclude with practical recommendations for mitigating these issues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have found that ambient air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular disease exacerbation. OBJECTIVES: Given previous findings, we hypothesized that particulate air pollution might induce systemic inflammation in myocardial infarction (MI) survivors, contributing to an increased vulnerability to elevated concentrations of ambient particles. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study of 1,003 MI survivors was performed in six European cities between May 2003 and July 2004. We compared repeated measurements of interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) with concurrent levels of air pollution. We collected hourly data on particle number concentrations (PNC), mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM) {\textexclamdown} 10 microm (PM(10)) and {\textexclamdown} 2.5 microm (PM(2.5)), gaseous pollutants, and meteorologic data at central monitoring sites in each city. City-specific confounder models were built for each blood marker separately, adjusting for meteorology and time-varying and time-invariant covariates. Data were analyzed with mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Pooled results show an increase in IL-6 when concentrations of PNC were elevated 12-17 hr before blood withdrawal [percent change of geometric mean, 2.7; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-4.6]. Five day cumulative exposure to PM(10) was associated with increased fibrinogen concentrations (percent change of arithmetic mean, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.1-1.1). Results remained stable for smokers, diabetics, and patients with heart failure. No consistent associations were found for CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate an immediate response to PNC on the IL-6 level, possibly leading to the production of acute-phase proteins, as seen in increased fibrinogen levels. This might provide a link between air pollution and adverse cardiac events.},

The intercomparison took place in two stages:\, the first round of the intercomparison was conducted when filter samples collected during the ACE-Asia experiment were being analyzed for OC and EC, and the second round was conducted after the ACE-Asia experiment and included selected samples from the ACE-Asia experiment. Each participant operated ECOC analyzers from the same manufacturer and utilized the same analysis protocol for their measurements. The precision of OC measurements of quartz fiber filters was a function of the filter's carbon loading but was found to be in the range of 4-13\% for OC loadings of 1.0-25 {$\mu$}g of C cm-2. For measurements of EC, the precision was found to be in the range of 6-21\% for EC loadings in the range of 0.7-8.4 {$\mu$}g of C cm-2. It was demonstrated for three ambient samples, four source samples, and three complex mixtures of organic compounds that the relative amount of total evolved carbon allocated as OC and EC (i.e., the ECOC split) is sensitive to the temperature program used for analysis, and the magnitude of the sensitivity is dependent on the types of aerosol particles collected. The fraction of elemental carbon measured in wood smoke and an extract of organic compounds from a wood smoke sample were sensitive to the temperature program used for the ECOC analysis. The ECOC split for the three ambient samples and a coal fly ash sample showed moderate sensitivity to temperature program, while a carbon black sample and a sample of secondary organic aerosol were measured to have the same split of OC and EC with all temperature programs that were examined.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a widespread environmental exposure and leading health risk factor. The health effects of PM may be mediated by its oxidative potential; however, the combustion and non-combustion sources and components of PM responsible for its oxidative potential are poorly understood, particularly in low- and middle-income rural settings where coal and biomass burning for cooking and heating contribute to PM exposure. METHODS: We measured 24-h personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of 20 rural women in northern (Inner Mongolia) and southern (Sichuan) Chinese provinces who used solid fuels (i.e., coal, biomass). PM2.5 exposures were characterized for mass, black carbon, water-soluble organic carbon, major water-soluble ions, and 47 elements. The oxidative potential of PM2.5 exposures was measured using acellular (dithiothreitol-based) and cellular (macrophage-based) assays. We performed factor and correlation analyses using the chemical components of PM2.5 to identify sources of exposure to PM2.5 and their chemical markers. Associations between oxidative potential and chemical markers for major sources of PM2.5 exposure were assessed using linear regression models. RESULTS: Women's geometric mean PM2.5 exposures were 249{$\mu$}gm(-3) (range: 53.9-767) and 83.9{$\mu$}gm(-3) (range: 73.1-95.5) in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan, respectively. Dust, biomass combustion, and coal combustion were identified as the major sources of exposure to PM2.5. Markers for dust (iron, aluminum) were significantly associated with intrinsic oxidative potential [e.g., one interquartile range increase in iron (ppm) was associated with an 85.5\% (95\% CI: 21.5, 149) increase in cellular oxidative potential ({$\mu$}gZymosanmg(-1))], whereas markers for coal (arsenic, non-sulfate sulfur) and biomass (black carbon, cadmium) combustion were not associated with oxidative potential. CONCLUSIONS: Dust was largely responsible for the intrinsic oxidative potential of PM2.5 exposures of rural Chinese women, whereas biomass and coal combustion were not significantly associated with intrinsic oxidative potential.},

Such high ratios also exhibited seasonal variation, and differed across land use types; significant differences occurred at locations classified as forest, agriculture, and mobile, but not in locations classified as commercial, desert, industrial, and residential. On average, the excess, or non-sulfate, sulfur (unmeasured organic sulfur or other inorganic species of sulfur) was variable and observed as high as {\textasciitilde}13\% of organic carbon and {\textasciitilde}2\% of PM2.5. The contribution of such assumed organosulfur was larger in the eastern region than other geographical locations in the United States. Besides the temporal and spatial trends, the additional sulfur was found to be related to other factors such as aerosol acidity and emission sources. The results suggest that these unmeasured sulfur species could have significant contribution to aerosol burden, and the understanding of these could help to control PM2.5 levels and to assess other effects of sulfur aerosols.},

  abstract = {Population migration has upgraded the direct energy consumption with remarkable benefits on air quality and health in China.           ,                             Direct residential and transportation energy consumption (RTC) contributes significantly to ambient fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 {$\mu$}m (PM               2.5               ) in China. During massive rural-urban migration, population and pollutant emissions from RTC have evolved in terms of magnitude and geographic distribution, which was thought to worsen PM               2.5               levels in cities but has not been quantitatively addressed. We quantify the temporal trends and spatial patterns of migration to cities and evaluate their associated pollutant emissions from RTC and subsequent health impact from 1980 to 2030. We show that, despite increased urban RTC emissions due to migration, the net effect of migration in China has been a reduction of PM               2.5               exposure, primarily because of an unequal distribution of RTC energy mixes between urban and rural areas. After migration, people have switched to cleaner fuel types, which considerably lessened regional emissions. Consequently, the national average PM               2.5               exposure concentration in 2010 was reduced by 3.9 {$\mu$}g/m               3               (90\% confidence interval, 3.0 to 5.4 {$\mu$}g/m               3               ) due to migration, corresponding to an annual reduction of 36,000 (19,000 to 47,000) premature deaths. This reduction was the result of an increase in deaths by 142,000 (78,000 to 181,000) due to migrants swarming into cities and decreases in deaths by 148,000 (76,000 to 194,000) and 29,000 (15,000 to 39,000) due to transitions to a cleaner energy mix and lower urban population densities, respectively. Locally, however, megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai experienced increases in PM               2.5               exposure associated with migration because these cities received massive immigration, which has driven a large increase in local emissions.},

The Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) is a randomized intervention trial evaluating the respiratory health effects of reducing indoor air pollution from open cooking fires. A total of 504 rural Mayan women in highland Guatemala aged 15--50 years, all using traditional indoor open fires, were randomized to either receive a chimney woodstove (plancha) or continue using the open fire. Assessments of chronic respiratory symptoms and lung function and individual measurements of carbon monoxide exposure were performed at baseline and every 6 months up to 18 months. Use of a plancha significantly reduced carbon monoxide exposure by 61.6\%. For all respiratory symptoms, reductions in risk were observed in the plancha group during follow-up; the reduction was statistically significant for wheeze (relative risk\,=\,0.42, 95\% confidence interval: 0.25, 0.70). The number of respiratory symptoms reported by the women at each follow-up point was also significantly reduced by the plancha (odds ratio\,=\,0.7, 95\% confidence interval: 0.50, 0.97). However, no significant effects on lung function were found after 12--18 months. Reducing indoor air pollution from household biomass burning may relieve symptoms consistent with chronic respiratory tract irritation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Improved biomass and advanced fuel cookstoves can lower household air pollution (HAP), but levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) often remain above the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended interim target of 35{$\mu$}g/m3. Methods: Based on existing literature, we first estimate a range of likely levels of personal PM2.5 before and after a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) intervention. Using simulations reflecting uncertainty in both the exposure estimates and exposure-response coefficients, we estimate corresponding expected health benefits for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adults, birthweight, and pneumonia incidence among children {$<$}2years old. We also estimate potential avoided premature mortality among those exposed. Results: Our best estimate is that an LPG stove intervention would decrease personal PM2.5 exposure from approximately 270{$\mu$}g/m3 to approximately 70{$\mu$}g/m3, due to likely continued use of traditional open-fire stoves. We estimate that this decrease would lead to a 5.5mmHg lower SBP among women over age 50, a 338g higher birthweight, and a 37\% lower incidence of severe childhood pneumonia. We estimate that decreased SBP, if sustained, would result in a 5\%--10\% decrease in mortality for women over age 50. We estimate that higher birthweight would reduce infant mortality by 4 to 11 deaths per 1000 births; for comparison, the current global infant mortality rate is 32/1000 live births. Reduced exposure is estimated to prevent approximately 29 cases of severe pneumonia per year per 1000 children under 2, avoiding approximately 2--3 deaths/1000 per year. However, there are large uncertainties around all these estimates due to uncertainty in both exposure estimates and in exposure-response coefficients; all health effect estimates include the null value of no benefit. Conclusions: An LPG stove intervention, while not likely to lower exposure to the WHO interim target level, is still likely to offer important health benefits.},

Methods:~         We enrolled 1279 adults (ages: 40--89 years) and conducted measurements in two winter campaigns in 2018--2019 and 2019--2020. Study staff traveled to participant homes to administer a questionnaire and measure brachial and central BP. Indoor temperature was measured in the 5 min prior to BP measurement. Outdoor temperature was estimated from regional meteorological stations. We used multivariable mixed-effects regression models to estimate the within-individual and between-individual effects of indoor and outdoor temperatures on BP.         Results:~         Indoor and outdoor temperatures ranged from 0.0 to 28 {$^\circ$}C and -14.3 to 6.4 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. In adjusted models, a 1 {$^\circ$}C increase in indoor temperature was associated with decreased SBP [-0.4 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI): -0.7 to -0.1 (between-individual; brachial and central BP); -0.5 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.8 to -0.2 (within-individual, brachial BP); -0.4 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.7 to -0.2 (within-individual, central BP)], DBP [-0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI:-0.4 to -0.03 (between-individual); -0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.5 to -0.04 (within-individual)], and within-individual pulse pressure [-0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.4 to -0.04 (central); -0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.4 to -0.1 (brachial)]. Between-individual SBP estimates were larger among participants with hypertension. There was no evidence of an effect of outdoor temperature on BP.         Conclusion:~         Our results support previous findings of inverse associations between indoor temperature and BP but contrast with prior evidence of an inverse relationship with outdoor temperature. Wintertime home heating may be a population-wide intervention strategy for high BP and cardiovascular disease in China.},

  abstract = {Biomass burning is an important source of particulate organic carbon (OC) in the atmosphere. Quantifying this contribution in time and space requires a means of routinely apportioning contributions of smoke from biomass burning to OC. Smoke marker (for example, levoglucosan) measurements provide the most common approach for making this determination. A lack of source profiles for wildfires and prescribed fires and the expense and complexity of traditional smoke marker measurement methods have thus far limited routine estimates of these contributions to ambient aerosol concentrations and regional haze. We report here on the collection of source profiles for combustion of numerous wildland fuels and on the development of an inexpensive and robust technique for routine smoke marker measurements. Hi-Volume filter source samples were collected during two studies at the Fire Science Laboratory in Missoula, MT in 2006 and 2007. Levoglucosan (and other carbohydrates) were measured in these samples using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Results of this analysis along with water-soluble potassium, OC, and elemental carbon are presented. The results show that emissions of levoglucosan are fairly correlated with OC with an average ratio of 0.031 {$\mu$}g C/{$\mu$}g C. Further, there was a definite pattern that emerged based on fuel component burned with the typical levoglucosan/OC ratio of branches {$>$} straw {$>$} needles {$>$} leaves. Additionally, this carbohydrate measurement method appears to provide fingerprint information about the type of fuel burned that could help constrain profiles chosen for aerosol source apportionment and lead to a better determination of source contributions from biomass burning.},

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and fibrinogen are arguably the four most commonly assayed markers to reflect the relationships of PM with inflammation and blood coagulation. This review summarized and quantitatively analyzed the existing studies reporting short- and long-term associations of PM2.5(PM with an aerodynamic diameter {$\leq$}2.5~{$\mu$}m)/PM10 (PM with an aerodynamic diameter{$\leq$}10~{$\mu$}m) with important inflammation and blood coagulation markers (TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-6, IL-8, fibrinogen). We reviewed relevant studies published up to July 2020, using three English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase) and two Chinese databases (Wang-Fang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure). The OHAT tool, with some modification, was applied to evaluate risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted with random-effects models for calculating the pooled estimate of markers. To assess the potential effect modifiers and the source of heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses where appropriate. The assessment and correction of publication bias were based on Begg's and Egger's test and ``trim-and-fill'' analysis. We identified 44 eligible studies. For short-term PM exposure, the percent change of a 10~{$\mu$}g/m3 PM2.5 increase on TNF-{$\alpha$} and fibrinogen was 3.51\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.21\%, 5.81\%) and 0.54\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.21\%, 0.86\%) respectively. We also found a significant short-term association between PM10 and fibrinogen (percent change~=~0.17\%, 95\% CI: 0.04\%, 0.29\%). Overall analysis showed that long-term associations of fibrinogen with PM2.5 and PM10 were not significant. Subgroup analysis showed that long-term associations of fibrinogen with PM2.5 and PM10 were significant only found in studies conducted in Asia. Our findings support significant short-term associations of PM with TNF-{$\alpha$} and fibrinogen. Future epidemiological studies should address the role long-term PM exposure plays in inflammation and blood coagulation markers level change.},

  abstract = {Abstract. To obtain a thorough knowledge of PM2.\,5 chemical composition and its impact on aerosol optical properties across China, existing field studies conducted after the year 2000 are reviewed and summarized in terms of geographical, interannual and seasonal distributions. Annual PM2.\,5 was up to 6 times the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in some megacities in northern China. Annual PM2.\,5 was higher in northern than southern cities, and higher in inland than coastal cities. In a few cities with data longer than a decade, PM2.\,5 showed a slight decrease only in the second half of the past decade, while carbonaceous aerosols decreased, sulfate (SO42-) and ammonium (NH4+) remained at high levels, and nitrate (NO3-) increased. The highest seasonal averages of PM2.\,5 and its major chemical components were typically observed in the cold seasons. Annual average contributions of secondary inorganic aerosols to PM2.\,5 ranged from 25 to 48\,\%, and those of carbonaceous aerosols ranged from 23 to 47\,\%, both with higher contributions in southern regions due to the frequent dust events in northern China. Source apportionment analysis identified secondary inorganic aerosols, coal combustion and traffic emission as the top three source factors contributing to PM2.\,5 mass in most Chinese cities, and the sum of these three source factors explained 44 to 82\,\% of PM2.\,5 mass on annual average across China. Biomass emission in most cities, industrial emission in industrial cities, dust emission in northern cities and ship emission in coastal cities are other major source factors, each of which contributed 7--27\,\% to PM2.\,5 mass in applicable cities. The geographical pattern of scattering coefficient (bsp) was similar to that of PM2.\,5, and that of aerosol absorption coefficient (bap) was determined by elemental carbon (EC) mass concentration and its coating. bsp in ambient condition of relative humidity (RH)\,\,=\,\,80\,\% can be amplified by about 1.8 times that under dry conditions. Secondary inorganic aerosols accounted for about 60\,\% of aerosol extinction coefficient (bext) at RH greater than 70\,\%. The mass scattering efficiency (MSE) of PM2.\,5 ranged from 3.0 to 5.0\,m2\,g-1 for aerosols produced from anthropogenic emissions and from 0.7 to 1.0\,m2\,g-1 for natural dust aerosols. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of EC ranged from 6.5 to 12.4\,m2\,g-1 in urban environments, but the MAE of water-soluble organic carbon was only 0.05 to 0.11\,m2\,g-1. Historical emission control policies in China and their effectiveness were discussed based on available chemically resolved PM2.\,5 data, which provides the much needed knowledge for guiding future studies and emissions policies.},

  year = {2015},

  address = {New York},
  abstract = {"The book provides an accessible but comprehensive overview of methods for mediation and interaction. There has been considerable and rapid methodological development on mediation and moderation/interaction analysis within the causal-inference literature over the last ten years. Much of this material appears in a variety of specialized journals, and some of the papers are quite technical. There has also been considerable interest in these developments from empirical researchers in the social and biomedical sciences. However, much of the material is not currently in a format that is accessible to them. The book closes these gaps by providing an accessible, comprehensive, book-length coverage of mediation. The book begins with a comprehensive introduction to mediation analysis, including chapters on concepts for mediation, regression-based methods, sensitivity analysis, time-to-event outcomes, methods for multiple mediators, methods for time-varying mediation and longitudinal data, and relations between mediation and other concepts involving intermediates such as surrogates, principal stratification, instrumental variables, and Mendelian randomization. The second part of the book concerns interaction or "moderation," including concepts for interaction, statistical interaction, confounding and interaction, mechanistic interaction, bias analysis for interaction, interaction in genetic studies, and power and sample-size calculation for interaction. The final part of the book provides comprehensive discussion about the relationships between mediation and interaction and unites these concepts within a single framework. This final part also provides an introduction to spillover effects or social interaction, concluding with a discussion of social-network analyses. The book is written to be accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics. Comprehensive appendices provide more technical details for the interested reader. Applied empirical examples from a variety of fields are given throughout. Software implementation in SAS, Stata, SPSS, and R is provided. The book should be accessible to students and researchers who have completed a first-year graduate sequence in quantitative methods in one of the social- or biomedical-sciences disciplines. The book will only presuppose familiarity with linear and logistic regression, and could potentially be used as an advanced undergraduate book as well"--},

Historically, wearable aerosol monitors have proven to be expensive, noisy, and burdensome. The objective of this work was to develop a new type of wearable monitor, an ultrasonic personal aerosol sampler (UPAS), to overcome many of the technological limitations in personal exposure assessment. The UPAS is a time-integrated monitor that features a novel micropump that is virtually silent during operation. A suite of onboard environmental sensors integrated with this pump measure and record mass airflow (0.5-3.0 L/min, accurate within 5\%), temperature, pressure, relative humidity, light intensity, and acceleration. Rapid development of the UPAS was made possible through recent advances in low-cost electronics, open-source programming platforms, and additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping. Interchangeable cyclone inlets provided a close match to the EPA PM2.5 mass criterion (within 5\%) for device flows at either 1.0 or 2.0 L/min. Battery life varied from 23 to 45 hours depending on sample flow rate and selected filter media. Laboratory tests of the UPAS prototype demonstrate excellent agreement with equivalent federal reference method samplers for gravimetric analysis of PM2.5 across a broad range of concentrations.},

  abstract = {Cooperative multi-agent tasks require agents to deduce their own contributions with shared global rewards, known as the challenge of credit assignment. General methods for policy based multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve the challenge introduce differentiate value functions or advantage functions for individual agents. In multi-agent system, polices of different agents need to be evaluated jointly. In order to update polices synchronously, such value functions or advantage functions also need synchronous evaluation. However, in current methods, value functions or advantage functions use counter-factual joint actions which are evaluated asynchronously, thus suffer from natural estimation bias. In this work, we propose the approximatively synchronous advantage estimation. We first derive the marginal advantage function, an expansion from single-agent advantage function to multi-agent system. Further more, we introduce a policy approximation for synchronous advantage estimation, and break down the multi-agent policy optimization problem into multiple sub-problems of single-agent policy optimization. Our method is compared with baseline algorithms on StarCraft multi-agent challenges, and shows the best performance on most of the tasks.},

Whether the use of indoor air purifiers is still necessary needs further exploration. A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 54 healthy students in Beijing, China. Participants were randomized assigned to the use of real or sham high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) for a week and changed the status after a washout period. Health measurements of cardiorespiratory biomarkers were performed at the end of each period. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between PM2.5 exposure and cardiorespiratory biomarkers. Compared with sham air purification, average diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and 8-isoprostane (8-isoPGF2{$\alpha$}) levels decreased significantly in the real purification. The effects of indoor air purification on lung function indicators including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and forced expiratory flow between the 25th and 75th percentile of forced vital capacity (FEF25\%--75\%) were also significant. Our findings showed a protective effect of indoor HEPA air purifiers on cardiorespiratory health of young healthy adults reflected by the decreased blood pressure, respiratory inflammation, and systematic oxidative stress and improved lung function.},

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis -- with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates -- can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               A variety of public health interventions have been undertaken in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with household air pollution (HAP) due to cooking, heating and lighting with solid biomass fuels. Pregnant women and children under five are particularly vulnerable to the effects of HAP, due to biological susceptibility and typically higher exposure levels. However, the relative health benefits of interventions to reduce HAP exposure among these groups remain unclear. This systematic review aims to assess, among pregnant women, infants and children (under 5 years) in LMIC settings, the effectiveness of interventions which aim to reduce household air pollutant emissions due to household solid biomass fuel combustion, compared to usual cooking practices, in terms of health outcomes associated with HAP exposure.                                         Methods                                This protocol follows standard systematic review processes and abides by the PRISMA-P reporting guidelines. Searches will be undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), The Global Index Medicus (GIM),                 ClinicalTrials.gov                 and Greenfile, combining terms for pregnant women and children with interventions or policy approaches to reduce HAP from biomass fuels or HAP terms and LMIC countries. Included studies will be those reporting (i) pregnant women and children under 5 years; (ii) fuel transition, structural, educational or policy interventions; and (iii) health events associated with HAP exposure which occur among pregnant women or among children within the perinatal period, infancy and up to 5 years of age. A narrative synthesis will be undertaken for each population-intervention-outcome triad stratified by study design. Clinical and methodological homogeneity within each triad will be used to determine the feasibility for undertaking meta-analyses to give a summary estimate of the effect for each outcome.                                                        Discussion               This systematic review will identify the effectiveness of existing HAP intervention measures in LMIC contexts, with discussion on the context of implementation and adoption, and summarise current literature of relevance to maternal and child health. This assessment reflects the need for HAP interventions which achieve measurable health benefits, which would need to be supported by policies that are socially and economically acceptable in LMIC settings worldwide.

It is therefore difficult to adequately evaluate the equivalence of this instrument in Chinese populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a culturally translated SGRQ-MC, and to estimate clinically important differences (CID) for the SGRQ in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in China. DESIGN: SGRQ was translated into Mandarin using standardised forward and backward translation procedures. Health status and clinical data were collected at baseline in 491 patients with stable COPD and again after 1 week in 131 randomly selected patients. All patients were followed up monthly and assessed during exacerbations and at 1 year. RESULTS: The SGRQ-MC showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity and known-group validity. Responsiveness was shown by significant changes in SGRQ-MC scores between stable stage and exacerbation (P{$<$}0.0001). The estimated CID for the total score ranged from 3.1 (95\%CI -0.3-6.5) to 7.7 (95\%CI -1.7-17.2). CONCLUSION: This SGRQ-MC is a reliable, valid and responsive instrument for quality of life evaluation in COPD patients in China. As it is culturally and clinically equivalent to other versions, measures can be compared among countries.},

Seventy-three nonsmoking healthy adults (mean age 23.3, SD 5.4 years) were followed with up to four repeated visits across 15 months in Beijing in 2014--2016. Biomarkers relevant to myocardial damage (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTnI]), inflammation (growth differentiation factor-15 [GDF-15]), and oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2{$\prime$}-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]) were measured at each visit, while ambient air pollution and temperature were monitored throughout the study. Linear mixed-effects models coupled with distributed lag nonlinear models were used to assess the impacts of each exposure measure on study outcomes. During follow-up, average daily concentrations of fine particulate matter and outdoor temperature were 62.9 {\textmu}g/m               3               (8.1--331.0 {\textmu}g/m               3               ) and 10.1 {$^\circ$}C (-6.5{$^\circ$}C to 29.5{$^\circ$}C). Serum hs-cTnI levels were detectable in 18.2\% of blood samples, with 27.4\% of individuals having {$\geq$}1 detectable values. Higher levels of ambient particulates and gaseous pollutants (per interquartile range) up to 14 days before clinical visits were associated with significant alterations in hs-cTnI levels of 22.9\% (95\% CI, 6.4, 39.4) to 154.7\% (95\% CI, 94.4, 215.1). These changes were accompanied by elevations of circulating GDF-15 and urinary 8-OHdG levels. Both low (5th percentile, -2.5 {$^\circ$}C) and high (95th percentile, 24.8{$^\circ$}C) outdoor temperatures, with breakpoint at {\textasciitilde}13.0{$^\circ$}C as the reference level, were also associated with elevations of hs-cTnI levels. Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and temperature was associated with cardiac troponin, a biomarker of myocardial damage, along with increased inflammation and oxidative stress responses. These findings extend our understanding of the biological mechanisms linking pervasive environmental exposure to adverse cardiac events.},

  abstract = {Background:                ~Unfavourable blood pressure (BP) level is an established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), while the exact underlying reasons for unfavourable BP are poorly understood. ~The INTERMAP China Prospective (ICP) Study is a prospective cohort to investigate the relationship of environmental and nutritional risk factors with key indicators of vascular function~(BP, arterial stiffness, carotid-intima media thickness)~among middle-aged/older men and women.                                            Methods:                ~A total of 839 Chinese participants aged 40-59 years from three diverse regions of China were enrolled in INTERMAP in 1997/98; data collection included repeated BP measurements, 24-hour urine specimens, and 24-hour dietary recalls. ~In 2015/16, 574 of these 839 persons were re-enrolled along with 208 new participants aged 40-59 years that were randomly selected from the same study villages. ~Participant's environmental and dietary exposures and health outcomes were assessed in this open cohort study, including BP, 24-hour dietary recalls, personal exposures to air pollution, grip strength, arterial stiffness, carotid-media thickness and plaques, cognitive function, and sleep patterns. ~Serum and plasma specimens were collected with 24-hour urine specimens.~A follow-up visit has been scheduled for 2020-2021.                                            Discussion:                ~~Winter and summer assessments of a comprehensive set of vascular indicators and their environmental and nutritional risk factors were conducted with high precision. ~We will leverage advances in exposome research to identify biomarkers of exposure to environmental and nutritional risk factors and improve our understanding of the mechanisms and pathways of their hazardous cardiovascular effects. ~The ICP Study is observational by design, thus subject to several biases including selection bias (e.g., loss to follow-up), information bias (e.g., measurement error), and confounding that we sought to mitigate through our study design and measurements.~ However, extensive efforts will apply to minimize those limitations (continuous observer training, repeated measurements of BP, standardized methods in data collection and measurements, and on-going quality control).},

We examined the impact of Rule 4901, aimed at reducing residential wood burning, on particulate matter levels and hospitalizations in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB).              Methods. Using general linear mixed models and generalized estimating equation models, we compared levels of particulate matter and of hospital admissions (age groups\,=\,45--64 and {$\geq$}\,65 years) in the SJVAB for cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during the burn seasons before (2000--2003) and after (2003--2006) implementation.              Results. After implementation, we observed reductions of 12\%, 11\%, and 15\% in particulate matter\, 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller (PM2.5), and 8\%, 7\%, and 11\% in coarse particles, in the entire SJVAB and in rural and urban regions of the air basin, respectively. Among those aged 65 years and older, Rule 4901 was estimated to prevent 7\%, 8\%, and 5\% of CVD cases, and 16\%, 17\%, and 13\% of IHD cases, in the entire SJVAB and in rural and urban regions, respectively.              Conclusions. The study suggests that Rule 4901 is effective at reducing wintertime ambient PM2.5 levels and decreasing hospital admissions for heart disease among people aged 65 years and older.},

  abstract = {Background:               Approximately 3 to 4 billion people worldwide are exposed to household air pollution, which has been associated with increased blood pressure (BP) in pregnant women in some studies.                                         Methods:                                We recruited 3195 pregnant women in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda and randomly assigned them to intervention or control groups. The intervention group received a gas stove and fuel during pregnancy, while the controls continued cooking with solid fuels. We measured BP and personal exposure to PM                 2.5                 , black carbon and carbon monoxide 3{\texttimes} during gestation. We conducted an intention-to-treat and exposure-response analysis to determine if household air pollution exposure was associated with increased gestational BP.                                                        Results:                                Median 24-hour PM                 2.5                 dropped from 84 to 24 {$\mu$}g/m                 3                 after the intervention; black carbon and carbon monoxide decreased similarly. Intention-to-treat analyses showed an increase in systolic BP and diastolic BP in both arms during gestation, as expected, but the increase was greater in intervention group for both systolic BP (0.69 mm\,Hg [0.03--1.35];                 P                 =0.04) and diastolic BP (0.62 mm\,Hg [0.05--1.19];                 P                 =0.03). The exposure-response analyses suggested that higher exposures to household air pollution were associated with moderately higher systolic BP and diastolic BP; however, none of these associations reached conventional statistical significance.                                                        Conclusions:               In intention-to-treat, we found higher gestational BP in the intervention group compared with controls, contrary to expected. In exposure-response analyses, we found a slight increase in BP with higher exposure, but it was not statistically significant. Overall, an intervention with gas stoves did not markedly affect gestational BP.},

Biomass fuels and coal provided similar contributions to health impacts. These findings are particularly true for rural populations, which contribute more to emissions and face higher premature death risks than urban populations. The impacts of both residential and nonresidential emissions are interconnected, and efforts are necessary to simultaneously mitigate both emission types.},

Here we estimate the drivers of the improved PM               2.5               air quality and the associated health benefits in China from 2013 to 2017 based on a measure-specific integrated evaluation approach, which combines a bottom-up emission inventory, a chemical transport model, and epidemiological exposure-response functions. The estimated national population--weighted annual mean PM               2.5               concentrations decreased from 61.8 (95\%CI: 53.3--70.0) to 42.0 {\textmu}g/m               3               (95\% CI: 35.7--48.6) in 5 y, with dominant contributions from anthropogenic emission abatements. Although interannual meteorological variations could significantly alter PM               2.5               concentrations, the corresponding effects on the 5-y trends were relatively small. The measure-by-measure evaluation indicated that strengthening industrial emission standards (power plants and emission-intensive industrial sectors), upgrades on industrial boilers, phasing out outdated industrial capacities, and promoting clean fuels in the residential sector were major effective measures in reducing PM               2.5               pollution and health burdens. These measures were estimated to contribute to 6.6- (95\% CI: 5.9--7.1), 4.4- (95\% CI: 3.8--4.9), 2.8- (95\% CI: 2.5--3.0), and 2.2- (95\% CI: 2.0--2.5) {\textmu}g/m               3               declines in the national PM               2.5               concentration in 2017, respectively, and further reduced PM               2.5               -attributable excess deaths by 0.37 million (95\% CI: 0.35--0.39), or 92\% of the total avoided deaths. Our study confirms the effectiveness of China's recent clean air actions, and the measure-by-measure evaluation provides insights into future clean air policy making in China and in other developing and polluting countries.},

However, in some cities, the PM               2.5               concentrations exceed the national ambient air quality standard of 35~{$\mu$}g/m               3               . Herein, we evaluated the historical trends of PM               2.5               from 2014 to 2022 in mainland China and found continuously declining trends. However, the annual decline rates decreased despite increasing investments on pollution control, showing considerably diminishing marginal effects of these investments. Accumulative reduction in PM               2.5               concentrations is linearly dependent on the log-transformed accumulative investment in air pollution control. The standard of 35~{$\mu$}g/m               3               can be achieved by 2035 if the current efforts continue at the same pace. However, the standard of 35~{$\mu$}g/m               3               can weaken the momentum of future actions in cities where the standard has already been implemented. We proposed and tested two tiers with four or six levels of specific regional standards based on the regression model predictions from the historical data and demonstrated that more rigorous standards for regions where the current standard is already attained could provide more momentum for strengthening abatement efforts. The results show that both tiers are feasible if the level of abatement endeavor is maintained even with marginal effects. We also demonstrate that additional 135,000 or 384,000 deaths can be avoided by applying the regional standards. Health benefits are monetized and compared with the control costs, suggesting that compared to Tier-2, Tier-1 is more cost-effective and balanced across the mainland China.                        ,              Plain Language Summary                            Air quality in China has substantially improved since 2013 and the goal of meeting the national standard of 35~{$\mu$}g/m               3               is expected to be achieved by 2035. However, with significant spatial variations, a single standard will be very likely to weaken the momentum of future actions in cities where the standard has already been attained. We proposed two tiers of regional standards by quantifying the declining trends of PM               2.5               since 2013 for individual provinces. The feasibility and cost--benefit of the regional standards were evaluated, and the environmental and health benefits of implementing the local standards were demonstrated.                        ,              Key Points                                                                                     Different regional air quality standards for PM                     2.5                     are feasible and more beneficial than a single national one in China                                                                                             Implementing the regional PM                     2.5                     standards well developed in this study in 2035 will avoid additional 135,000--384,000 deaths},
